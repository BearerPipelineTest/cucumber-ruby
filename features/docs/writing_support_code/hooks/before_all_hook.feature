Feature: BeforeAll Hooks

  BeforeAll hooks can be used if you have some set-up to be done before all
  scenarios are executed.

  BeforeAll hooks are not aware of your configuration. Use AfterConfiguration if
  you need it.

  Scenario: A single BeforeAll hook

    A BeforeAll hook will be invoked a single time before all the scenarios are
    executed.

    Given a file named "features/f.feature" with:
      """
      Feature: BeforeAll hook
        Scenario: #1
          Then the BeforeAll hook has been called

        Scenario: #2

      """
    And a file named "features/step_definitions/steps.rb" with:
